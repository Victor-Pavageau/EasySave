## About

This project is a C# implementation of a backup management software called EasySave. The application allows users to create, execute, and manage backup jobs, supporting both full and differential backups, with an additional Settings section enabling users to encrypt specific files based on their extension, while logging activity for review. EasySave features a user-friendly interface with options for sequential or individual job execution, language customization, and robust error handling at launch. The software leverages threading systems, background workers, and a client-server system based on TCP/IP to ensure efficient and reliable functionality.

This project was undertaken during my first year of engineering studies (Bac+3 in the French education system) as part of a school assignment, providing valuable hands-on experience in software development and teamwork. Working in a group of three, we collaborated to design and implement the application, further developing our teamwork skills and understanding of practical software engineering concepts.
